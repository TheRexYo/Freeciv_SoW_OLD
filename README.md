- A fantasy ruleset based on the fantasy world of Son of War. 
- Contains all the default contents of the 'Experimental' ruleset, which incorporates features from Civ2 and Civ3.
- There are plenty of dangers worth mentioning for even the most experienced players. Wild beasts, bandits, and even feral monsters lurk in hiding, prepared to cast down any unsuspecting nations.
- Magic is real. Research its properties to enhance your productivity!
- Each nation has its own strategy, with either special units and buildings, or a unique 'empire effect' used only by that empire, meaning that every game has plenty of diversity.
- A secret 'final boss' nation awaits those who intend to emulate the gods. Strike it down, and claim its power for yourself!
- Great Wonders have game-changing effects, and unlike in the base games, can actually define one's own playstyle.

Upcoming Features:
- Take part in nation-unique "Quests", which give immeasurable benefits if they are completed.
- Contend with powerful Event Empires, from brutal hordes to barbarian empires.
- Fight titanic legendary monsters, or subjugate them and claim their power for yourself!
