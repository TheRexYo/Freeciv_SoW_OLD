legend=_("Long ago, all of man lived as part of a single, unified\
 nation - the Neph Empire. The empire formed in response to\
 threats from the other races, and ultimately proceeded to\
 dominate the world with its incredible adaptability.\
 Even the most advanced empires of the time could not\
 compete - while an empire might surpass them in one\
 way, the Neph would defeat them in all the others.\
 In time, the all other races were assimilated,\
 exterminated, or forced into hiding, leaving man\
 as the sole ruler of Erath. With the threat eliminated,\
 the Neph Empire began to diverge in purpose, until it finally\
 collapsed.\
\n* No anarchy period after government change.\
\n* When this nation's cities are captured,\
 they inspire partisans, provided the requirements for\
 the 'Partisan' unit are met.\
